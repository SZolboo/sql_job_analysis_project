# Background
Driven by a quest to navigate the Data Analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others to find optimal jobs.

### Questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. Where are the top paying Data Analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are the most in demand for Data Analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. What are the most optical skills to learn?

# Tools I used
For my deep dive into the Data Analyst job market, I harnassed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

# The Analysis
Each query for this project aimed to investigate specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here is how I approached each question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
This SQL query aims to retrieve the top 10 highest-paying job postings for Data Analyst positions that have location flexibility (listed as "Anywhere"). It filters out job postings with missing salary information and presents essential details such as job title, company name, location, schedule type, salary, and posting date.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    company_dim.name AS company_name,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date
FROM job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim
    ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Here is the breakdown of the top Data Analyst jobs in 2023:
- **Diverse Salary Range:** Top 10 paying Data Analyst roles span from $184,000 to $650,000, indicating significant salary potential in the field.
- **Wide Range of Employers:** Companies like Meta, AT&T, and SmartAsset are among those offering high salaries, showing a broad interest across different industries.
- **Job Title Variety:** There is a high diversity in job titles, from ERM Data Analyst to Associate Director - Data Insights, reflecting varied roles and specializations within Data Analytics. 

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs
This SQL query aims to identify the skills required for the top-paying Data Analyst roles. It first selects the top 10 highest-paying Data Analyst job postings with location flexibility (listed as "Anywhere"). Then, it retrieves the associated company names, job titles, and average yearly salaries. In the subsequent part of the query, it joins these top-paying jobs with the skills required for each job. Finally, it presents the details of these top-paying jobs along with their required skills, ordered by salary in descending order.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
        job_id,
        company_dim.name AS company_name,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg
    FROM job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim
        ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE 
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        job_location = 'Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)

SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills 
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
    ON top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC;
```

### 3. In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts
**All Job Postings Worldwide:** This query identifies the most in-demand skills across all Data Analyst and Data Scientist job postings globally. It counts the occurrences of each skill, joins relevant tables to fetch skill details, and groups the results by skill. The output is sorted by demand count in descending order, limited to the top 10 skills.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
    ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short IN ('Data Analyst', 'Data Scientist')
GROUP BY skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY demand_count DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Job Postings in Australia:** Focused on Australian job postings, this query performs a similar analysis to the global query but filters for jobs located specifically in Australia. It counts the occurrences of skills required for Data Analyst and Data Scientist roles in Australia, groups them by skill, and sorts the results by demand count in descending order, limited to the top 10 skills.

```sql
SELECT 
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count_aus
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim 
    ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim
    ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE 
    job_title_short IN ('Data Analyst', 'Data Scientist') AND 
    job_country = 'Australia'
GROUP BY skills_dim.skills
ORDER BY demand_count_aus DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
